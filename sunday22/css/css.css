/* What is the specific HTML we want to style?
What are the qualities we want to modify (e.g. the properties of text in a paragraph)?
How do we want to modify the qualities of the element (e.g. font family, font color, font size, line height, letter spacing etc.)? */
/* 
CSS selectors are a way of declaring which HTML elements you wish to style. Selectors can appear a few different ways: The type of HTML element(h1, p, div, etc.) The value of an element's id or class (<p id=' idvalue'></p>, <p class=' classname'></p>)
 The value of an element's attributes (value="hello")
 The element's relationship with surrounding elements (a p within an element with class of .infobox) */
